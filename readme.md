# Features



- ... there's more...

# What should go in this lib

- Only battle-tested code with solid proven APIs that are not supposed to change.
- Only fully unit-tested code with coverage close to 100%. All the branches should absolutely be tested.
- Only generic and broad purpose functions, no domain or project-specific code.
- Dependencies will go as `peerDependencies` in this project, in order for the consuming project to have control over the version of each dependency (in their `yarn.lock`).
